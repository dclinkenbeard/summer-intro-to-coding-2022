# Introduction to Coding Workshop
This workshop is intended to serve as an example of why and how code is used in the sciences.  Much of modern science, regardless of the field, uses some form of code.  Code is used to simulate/predict the natural world, gather information from the natural world, and to analyze the copious amounts of data that is generated from both. 

## Who Is This For

This workshop is really for anyone that is curious about writing code, data, science, data science, statistics, or learning in general.  There is no expectation of previous knowledge.  There IS an expectation of an open mind and, most importantly, respect for your fellow students. 

We will start by discussing the absolute basics and getting familiar with some terminology. 

## The Difference Between Data and Information

Data are facts[*](#footnote000). 
- Blue
- Four
- Fish

 These are all data.  We must process our data to gain context and turn our data into information.   Context would be something like:

- The sky is *blue*
- Cats have *four* legs
- *Fish* live in water

Given a context we can then use our information to make an inference and gain knowledge: "That thing in sky is neither a cat nor a fish. It does NOT have four legs and so, I can infer, it must be a dog [**](#footnote001).
